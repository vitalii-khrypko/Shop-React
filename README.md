# Shop-React

Shop-React is an e-commerce web application built with React. The project utilizes React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, etc.) for managing the local state and handling side effects. The app provides a simple yet interactive shopping experience, allowing users to browse products, add them to their cart, and view the total price dynamically.

## Technologies
- **React** - for building the user interface and managing the application state.
- **useState** - for managing component-level state such as product data, cart items, etc.
- **useEffect** - for handling side effects like fetching product data from an API.
- **CSS3** - for styling the components.
- **Axios** - for fetching data from an external API.

## Features
- Browse through a list of products with images, descriptions, and prices.
- Add and remove items from the shopping cart.
- Dynamic updating of the cart total as items are added or removed.
- Responsive design that adapts to both desktop and mobile screens.
- Simple and interactive user interface with React hooks.
